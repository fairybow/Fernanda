/*

ISSUES:
- QTabBar loses system colors (will have transparent tabs) when border radius is applied (or any style except background)
- Additionally, text stops following the tab drag animation when style is applied. It'll just jump back and forth instead of sliding.
- We'll need a way to handle button hover/press highlights for the custom buttons (TabWidgetButton and CollapsibleWidgetHeader) (maybe use StyleContext)
- We may want a way to indicate that some sections of the base QSS should only be added when a theme is in effect (not default constructed theme) (cleanest solution may be clang-like "off" and "on" comments)
- Also want to remove user window theme access totally for now
- Look in QML for tab bar and buttons and whatever else
