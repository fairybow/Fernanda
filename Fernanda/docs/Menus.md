## Notes/Todo

Save will be fundamentally different for each Workspace. Save, Save As, Save All, Save All In Window, etc, for Notepad. But for Notebook we only have Save, which will save the entire archive.

This means closing may also be different, as we may not need to save when closing an edited file (and we'll persist changes on the temp files until saved or discarded on exit).
