Fernanda is my attempt at a distraction-free text editor for fiction writing. Work on single files like a notepad or organize whole projects in [Notebooks (`.fnx`)](Fernanda/docs/Notebooks.md).

Mac and Linux support is planned!

I think, in part, I made this because I wanted to put off writing for as long as possible (as writers are wont to do). But I also wanted to make something all my own, something difficult yet rewarding that was way out of my realm of experience. It's taken forever, and it's still not done (it'll never be *done*-done), but it's well on its way now. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope we'll meet again.
